Iâ€™m a Russian programmer doing this over 13 years already.
I was working for different companies from small outsourcing
companies serving big enterprises to big IT companies (Google).

Through my career, I've used almost all popular languages: C,
C++, Python, Java, Go, HTML/CSS/SASS, Ruby, JavaScript,
TypeScript, Kotlin, etc.

Recently I decided to quit my last work and dedicate year or
two of my life to myself and things I like.

From that time (starting from June 2018) few projects were born:

[Taskmony](https://app.taskmony.com) - the best task tracker
I ever used.

[GQL Alchemy](https://github.com/gql-alchemy/gql-alchemy) -
GraphQL implementation for Python 3.6

I hope more will come later (because I have Taskmony now I can
get very organized and productive).

Stay tuned!
