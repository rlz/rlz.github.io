title: Why all tasks trackers kill people self-efficacy
category: self-efficacy
---

During my work carrier I was working in many IT companies and
organized my work according to many methodologies (Agile, Scrum,
Kanban, Objectives and Key Results, Extreme Programming, etc.)
and used
many tasks and issue trackers (Bugzilla, Jira, YouTrack, Pivotal,
Asana, Trello and other including developed in-house and not
publicly available).

After all those years I can admit that I was most productive
and people around me were most productive in those companies
which
do not follow any particular methodology at all (one of those
companies were Google) and do not use any tool for task tracking.

To be precise they all use something for issue tracking, but it
was only used to track bugs or write down
nice-to-have-do-not-have-time-to-work-on-now ideas for future.
Or track
projects on a very high level when on a single task few engineers
can work for few weeks and that single task used for commenting
and logging all the activities. But not for day to day tasks
tracking.

I also was trying to use tasks trackers to track my personal
projects and day to day activities, but always after few days or
weeks I stop using them. I found that it is also true for many people
around me. _(Jumping a bit forward I can say that I've developed
own tasks tracker which I use for all aspects of my life now for a
few months already and I happy with it. You can try it too --- it's
free, get an account on
[https://app.taskmony.com](https://app.taskmony.com). I'm going
to describe it and why it improves your productivity
in few articles later)_

It looks like tasks trackers give us too little benefits and
require too much effort to keep them up to date and finally we stop
using them unless management enforce it and in that
case, we became less productive.

Why tools which intended to improve our productivity in reality
make as less productive both as persons and as a team?

This is my list of reasons.

## Mixing all types of tasks in a single system

Not all tasks have the same life cycle. There are small tasks, like
fix web city title, arrange some meeting or discuss the latest variant
of your new product logo with a designer. You can do 5-15 or those
tasks in a single day, and you need nothing more, but some help to do
not forget them.

There are bugs or issues or some problems with your
product, and you need lots of information attached to it like a
screenshot of the problem, which versions or sites are affected, who
is responsible for fixing it, severity, etc. They are often reported
from outside of the team.

There are ideas, which you want to write down to return to them
later, but don't have resources to work on them right now. You
need to remember them, maybe discuss it with co-workers.
But you do not want to see them and think about them
every day.

There are complex projects-like tasks which required many people
work on them, coordinate, discuss, finish many smaller activities
to make it done.

What I see in current modern issue trackers --- they try to fit
everything and if you do start to use them for everything
you will get a complete mess in your task tracker which will slowly
destroy your productivity. A thousand issues are not what you want to
see when you are looking into your tasks tracker with the only
goal --- to know what to do next. Trying to fix that by introducing
tags, due to dates, priorities makes it even worse --- you start
to spend to much time to manage all of that instead of doing
actual work and still have a mess.

How productive companies address that? In my experience, they use
trackers only for bug tracking, or sometimes for bug and ideas
tracking or for big tasks to coordinate, but never for small day
to day tasks. So you still need some tools for small tasks
and rare go into actual task tracker. Ideas and big tasks are
often tracked in a different tool, like Google Docs, or some
wiki engine, like Confluence. It turns out they serve that purpose
better.

## Too many tools and information

Usually, modern tasks trackers allow you to store many metadata with
your tasks. Start date, creator, assignment, deadline, project,
picture, tags, priority, related tasks, dependent tasks, blockers,
collaborators, etc.

On the first look, it can seem better to have the ability to have
something than not to have. But when we are in the area of
productivity that it can be the opposite: many possibilities
destroy your productivity. You spend too much time by filling all
of that usually un-needed information or too much
energy to develop first and then to enforce practice to do not
use all of that unnecessary crap.

Most effective companies in my experience use old simple software
which cannot do much, but this make this software
more helpful. They still do way too much in my opinion.

In my opinion, I need only single line description of my tasks to
be most effective and quickly decide what to do next. To have tasks is
better than not to have at all (because it keeps me focused and
not to do what easier or more fun to do, but do is what needs to
be done). But I do not need priorities (I remember them with
no effort), deadline --- I always remember them if I remember a task
itself ---
it is the task that what I usually forget, not a deadline for the task.
I do not need assignments, because I need only own tasks 99% of the
time, etc.

And overall my job is not to fill all that information into the task
tracker and my job is not to create methodology what to use or what
not to use from all that crap I can fill in modern tasks tracker.
Simplicity and keeping only important fields is the key for
productivity.

## Lack of personal tasks management

If you use tasks tracker for a team, usually all tasks for all
members are mixed. So if you want to create your agenda
for today which will be 10-15 small tasks, like select pictures
for presentation or finally discuss this old bug with co-worker
to get advice, you will mess with other people. They probably
do not want to see all of that, it only your plan for the day and
most of popular tasks trackers do not allow you create personal
agenda for common projects.

But by itself to create such a plan is a critical tool
to increase self-efficacy. It allows you to keep the focus on
your important task and not to tend to do more easy tasks or more
fun to do. If you have a task "Finish this fucking presentation"
you more likely will finish it instead of spending time on
a lower priority, but so exciting other tasks.

That's all for today. In the next post, I'm going to explain how did I
address all of that after quit my last job and started to work only
on my own projects.
