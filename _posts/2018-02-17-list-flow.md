title: Query hierarchical structures in Python
category: programming
---

Recently I need to write tests in Python for code which generates
big hierarchical structures (in my case it was dicts of lists of 
dicts, etc.) Asserting all of that was not nice task at all. I've 
started to think about some query language for that. Quick 
googling shows that there are few projects which addressed that 
issue: [ObjectPath](http://objectpath.org/),
[jsonpath-rw](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonpath-rw) and
[jsonpath-ng](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonpath-ng).

It turns out I do not like all of them. I do not like approach, 
syntax.

After a dozen of minutes of thinking about my next step, I come 
up with an alternate self-made approach which showed itself to be 
very effective for my task.

This approach was inspired by .NET LINQ (for .NET collections), 
that I used a long time ago and MatLab/Octave which I was 
experimenting with recently.

So I got an idea to run queries on standard collections and 
chaining them as if you use extension methods for collections from 
LINQ. And I decided to represent all data as lists (iterables to 
be precise) similar to "everything is a matrix" approach from 
Octave. During writing this, I found it very similar to UNIX pipes
and filtering/processing of output lines. I hope this will help
to get the idea faster if you are familiar with this technologies.

This is a bit simpler version of what Iâ€™ve got:

```python
import typing as t
from itertools import chain

class ListFlow:
    def __init__(self, iterable: t.Iterable[t.Any]) -> None:
        self.__iterable = iterable

    def attr(self, name: str) -> 'ListFlow':
        return ListFlow((self.__getattr(i, name) for i in self.__iterable))

    def filter(self, cond: t.Callable[[t.Any], bool]) -> 'ListFlow':
        return ListFlow((i for i in self.__iterable if cond(i)))

    def eq(self, attr: str, value: t.Any) -> 'ListFlow':
        return self.filter(lambda i: self.__getattr(i, attr) == value)

    def neq(self, attr: str, value: t.Any) -> 'ListFlow':
        return self.filter(lambda i: self.__getattr(i, attr) != value)

    def map(self, func: t.Callable[[t.Any], t.Any]) -> 'ListFlow':
        return ListFlow((func(i) for i in self.__iterable))

    def keys(self) -> 'ListFlow':
        return self.map(lambda i: set(i.keys()))

    def values(self) -> 'ListFlow':
        return self.map(lambda i: list(i.values()))

    def select(self, *names: str) -> 'ListFlow':
        def gen() -> t.Iterable[t.Any]:
            for i in self.__iterable:
                new_i = {}
                for f in names:
                    new_i[f] = self.__getattr(i, f)
                yield new_i

        return ListFlow(gen())

    def flatten(self) -> 'ListFlow':
        return ListFlow(chain.from_iterable(self.__iterable))

    def list(self) -> t.List[t.Any]:
        return list(self.__iterable)

    def set(self) -> t.MutableSet[t.Any]:
        return set(self.__iterable)

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.list()) == 0

    def count(self) -> int:
        count = 0

        for _ in self.__iterable:
            count += 1

        return count

    @staticmethod
    def __getattr(item: t.Any, attr: str) -> t.Any:
        if isinstance(item, dict):
            return item[attr]
        return getattr(item, attr)
```

Usage examples
===

We are going to do out queries on iterables. If we have just single
value we will create single element list like:

```python
data = { "foo": "bar" }

q = ListFlow([data])
```

Now we can use `.attr` method to navigate by attributes (object 
attributes or dict values). Use `.flatten` to make lists flat.
Use `.keys` or `.values` to get list of all keys from all dicts in
current iterable or all values. Use `.filter` (or more specific 
`.eq`, `.neq`) to filter current items. We can use `.select` to
convert items to dicts with copied values. Or finaly we can use
`.set`, `.list` or `.count`, `.is_empty` to extract data.

Note that all operations are lazy.

Now imagine we have data like that:

```python
sample_data = {
    "foo": {
        "bar": [
            {
                "a": 1,
                "foo": "bar",
                "b": "xxx",
                "c": "yyy"
            },
            {
                "a": 0,
                "foo": "abc",
                "b": None,
                "c": None
            },
            {
                "a": 0,
                "foo": "bar",
                "b": None,
                "c": None
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Selecting subitems:

```python
ListFlow([sample_data]).attr("foo").attr("bar")
```

gives us iterable with this structure

```python
[
    [
        {
            "a": 1,
            "foo": "bar",
            "b": "xxx",
            "c": "yyy"
        },
        {
            "a": 0,
            "foo": "abc",
            "b": None,
            "c": None
        },
        {
            "a": 0,
            "foo": "bar",
            "b": None,
            "c": None
        }
    ]
]
```

Flatten internal lists:

```python
# returns ["bar", "abc", "bar"]
ListFlow([sample_data]).attr("foo").attr("bar").flatten().attr("foo").list()
```

Assert that "b" and "c" always is `None` if "a" equal `0`:

```python
bar_data = ListFlow([sample_data]).attr("foo").attr("bar").flatten().list()

this.assertEqual(
    {None},
    ListFlow(bar_data).eq("a", 0).select("b", "c").values().flatten().set()
)
```

Assert that we have only "a", "b", "c" and "foo" keys:

```python
this.assertEqual(
    {"a", "b", "c", "foo"},
    ListFlow(bar_data).keys().flatten().set()
)
```

And so on.

This class is simple but gives the ability to select
data easily and expressively. It's easy 
to extend functionality to match your needs (etc. indexing
selection).

Now I'm thinking to create a library out of it.
