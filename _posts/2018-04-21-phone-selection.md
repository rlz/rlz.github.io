title: How I chose a phone
category: life
---

Several months ago I faced a problem with choosing my new phone. I'm sure
everyone did it few times, and we all periodically do the same.

Because I am an experienced engineer, I was going to do it right (A few
year prior that I used phones provided by an employer and had limited
choice). And I was almost unlimited on a budget (meaning I was able to
buy most expensive flagmen if I wish to do so). So I started from
market research by reading all the reviews comparisons opinions. I
spend many hours, few days and it was tough. Every phone had something
good and bad and it seems impossible to make a choice.

I start to be jealous about Apple-fans who have no choice (does
someone still think, that to have a significant amount of options is a
good thing?). So I stopped doing this for a while until a new idea came up
in my mind and resolved this problem in no time.

Instead of thinking of how to select the best phone I start thinking about
what is the most annoying thing in my previous phones. What do I want to
fix most?

For me, it was battery. Or to be more precise, a lifetime on a
single charge. So I googled something like "most durable phones."
And the top phone at that time was "Lenovo P2". It turns out that it also
has pretty good specs in everything except camera (camera is
shit). But it offers incredible three days without charge (and this is true,
I charge it once per two days though)! I've spent on that only 10 minutes.
So now I'm a happy and delighted user of it.

Conclusion. If you are in the process of selecting something you
already had experience with a car, a TV, a phone, a laptop, a wife
(just joking!), etc. instead of looking for tons of review think what the
most annoying factor is. Try to eliminate that factor in your
new device and with high probability, you will be satisfied by your
choice.

At the end my list of factors I'm looking for in new phone ordered by priority:

*   single charge lifetime
*   camera (quality of the non-selfy shot, video --- does not really
    matter)
*   resistance to accidental drops (no glass on both sides, no rounded
    screen, I hate when I need to replace that parts)

It is my list, but of course, you should think and create your own.

Good luck and choose smartly!
